  This won't be much of a blog yet, I'm afraid, as my thoughts are errant and fickle. In truth, I've wanted to start a blog for years, and just never really stoked those embers. I was never really sure what I'd talk about. Vintage radios? Fumbling through hacking projects? Bird watching? The list could go on, but there will be time for that later. 
  
  Thing is, it's important to know who you are writing it for.
