Welcome to the direct result of me slamming my face into a manual. I'm super bad at reading all of the instructions, but I'm working on it. Is this a blog? Sure, why not. What can you expect? Well...

- [] Posts from me about whatever project I am working on.
- [] Pictures of vintage radios. Seriously, I love the darned things. 
- [] Maybe one of those Persistant Browser-Based Game? If I can figure it out...
- [] Under construction gifs from 90's websites.
